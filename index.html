                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>
                        With a foundation in Economics and Data Science, I'm building my experience in cybersecurity by pursuing a Master's in Cybersecurity Engineering at USC, along with COMPTIA Security+ certification and Google's Cybersecurity Certificate. I'm passionate about data privacy and its far-reaching impact, particularly in protecting organizations that people trust every day. I deeply resonate with the ethical responsibility the role demands and believe it aligns with my values of ensuring equitable and trustworthy access to technology. With strong communication and programming skills, I want to support meaningful work with security teams and learn to stay resilient when facing an increasingly complex digital landscape.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey into cybersecurity is rooted in my interdisciplinary background. I earned my BA in Economics and Data Science with a minor in Business Law from the University of Southern California, where I cultivated a deep understanding of how data, markets, and regulation interact. My interest in tech had always been present—but it was through working on real-world problems in finance, healthcare, and public policy that I became drawn to protecting the very systems that power modern life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my undergraduate years, I worked on projects and internships that combined analytical thinking with purpose. At IREP Credit Capital, I supported rural entrepreneurship through micro-lending strategies. At Dalton Investments, I analyzed high-growth companies in emerging markets to inform investment decisions. And as a founding team member of Biokind Analytics, I partnered with healthcare nonprofits to streamline operations using data. In each of these roles, the increasing relevance of cybersecurity and digital trust became impossible to ignore—and I knew I wanted to be part of building safer systems from the ground up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, as I transition into cybersecurity, I bring a unique lens: one shaped by economics, grounded in ethics, and powered by a passion for using tech to drive social good.

                                <p>
                                    This project focuses on the design and evaluation of security policies for organizations 
                                    handling electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). The work applies industry standards 
                                    such as HIPAA and the NIST 800-66 framework to analyze access control, encryption, data segregation, 
                                    logging, and recovery mechanisms across on-prem and cloud environments. Using a real-world healthcare data 
                                    workflow, the project translates regulatory requirements into enforceable technical controls, demonstrating 
                                    how security policy design directly impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability in sensitive systems.

                                <p>
                                    This research paper explores decentralized key management systems 
                                    and how they challenge traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) models. 
                                    The paper analyzes how blockchain-based frameworks, decentralized 
                                    identifiers (DIDs), and threshold cryptography redistribute trust away from 
                                    centralized authorities and toward cryptographic protocols. Through architectural 
                                    analysis and real-world case studies, the work evaluates the security benefits, scalability, 
                                    and trade-offs of decentralized key management.

                                <p>
                                    This paper examines biometric authentication systems through
                                    the lens of privacy, security failures, and global regulation. 
                                    It analyzes biometric error models, data integrity risks, and 
                                    the consequences of irrevocable identity compromise, while comparing 
                                    regulatory approaches across the United States, Europe, India, and China. 
                                    highlights the tension between convenience, surveillance, and user privacy, 
                                    and emphasizes the need for stronger governance as biometric technologies 
                                    become increasingly embedded in everyday systems.

                                <p>
                                    This challenge simulated a cybersecurity consulting engagement, requiring the assessment of organizational 
                                    security risks, threat exposure, and control gaps under real-world constraints. The work focused on translating 
                                    technical findings into business impact, prioritizing risks, and proposing  mitigation strategies aligned 
                                    with operational and regulatory considerations. The final deliverable emphasized structured analysis and clear recommendations tailored to for the client.
