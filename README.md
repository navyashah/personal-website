# Personal Portfolio Website: https://navyashah.github.io/personal-website/

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site serves as a central place to showcase my projects, research, and experience across data science, cybersecurity, and consulting-focused work. It’s designed to be clean, fast, and easy to navigate—no frameworks, no unnecessary bloat.

The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep things lightweight and fully customizable.
